# Lethal Rebirth

Lethal Company is an efficient operation, but imperfections remain. Bugs, instability, and questionable balance are regrettable liabilities. This package aims to correct those faults, enhancing your tools, and expanding the catalog. All without compromising performance in any significant manner. Efficiency is mandatory. Profit is expected.

## Operational Summary

### Major features

The directive of Lethal Rebirth is simple: Preserve the integrity of standard Company operations. Core procedures remain familiar, but efficiency has been refined. Alongside improved stability and performance, enhancements include:

- **Bigger Teams, bigger profit**: Studies done by the Company have found that bigger teams make for more efficient work. There is no extension of the provided living space (the Company financed ship).

- **[Rebalanced Moons](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/dopadream/RebalancedMoonsBeta/)**: *No new locations authorized.* Existing *environments have been adjusted* for scrap yield, hostile presence, and navigation. Additional exits, traversal structures, and safety measures have been implemented where efficiency demanded.

- **New Interiors**: [Generic environments](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Generic_GMD/Generic_Interiors/) (including The Backrooms), Wesley’s extensions, the Lethal Office (inspired by [The Upturned](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1717770/The_Upturned/)), and the Slaughterhouse are accessible.

- **Better Immersion**: [Cave variants](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ButteryStancakes/Chameleon/), [new fog](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ironthumb/BetterFog/), and prettier foliage have been found.

- **New Hostiles**: Two additional threats: [The Locker](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/zealsprince/Locker/) (containment hazard) and The Shrimp (from [The Upturned](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1717770/The_Upturned/)). *Infestation variants and the reinstated Kidnapper Fox are also present.*

- **Masked**: In recent events the Company has found that entities, known as the Masked, have found ways to both mimic appearance and voice of any given employee. They seem to be rare yet should be encountered with caution.

- **[Lategame Upgrades](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/malco/Lategame_Upgrades/)**: Costs and functions adapted to progression.

  > ⚠️ The Hunter Upgrade is free of charge and replaces SellBodiesFixed. Acquisition must occur at round start.

- **[Utility Slots](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/ReservedUtilitySlot/)**: Up to *3 additional equipment slots* may be purchased. Most items are compatible.

- **Quota Rollover**: In the event of total personnel loss, quota rollover will be reduced by 20%.

- **Terminal Improvements**: *Expanded interface functions*, including *purchase packs* and *lobby management systems*.

- **The Casino** An officially sanctioned outlet for risk-oriented employees. Sadly, recently we have found that the assigned worth to a teammates bodies encourages desperate teams to resort to internal harm. The Company asks you to refrain from such behavior for the benefit of morale and efficiency in this operation.
