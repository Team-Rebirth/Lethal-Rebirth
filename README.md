> ## Promotion Announcement
>
> Congratulations, Contractor.
>
> Effective immediately, you are promoted to Elite Recovery Operative - Operation Rebirth. This promotion is not a courtesy. It is a metric-driven adjustment based on sustained profitability and demonstrated tolerance for hazardous assignment environments.
>
> As an Elite Recovery Operative you will be deployed to newly commissioned Company assets. These locations contain high-yield proprietary material and unverified hazards. Your role is to extract value, and return usable assets to Company custody.
> Previous recovery operations produced significant anomalous data. Including personnel apparent duplications. These phenomena are non-compensable and non-billable. If you encounter expired staff, doppelgängers, or other anomalous entities:
>
> - Do not engage outside of mission parameters.
> - Neutralize or bypass as required to preserve mission integrity.
> - Mark any recovered biological material as “non-standard” and route to containment.
>
> Noncompliance will affect promotional standing and future assignment eligibility.

## Operational Summary

### Major features

The concept of Lethal Rebirth is simple: optimize some of the game's mechanics, increase performance, and expand the experience without losing the vanilla feel. This includes

- **Bigger Teams**: Lobbies with up to 32 players (4-8 recommended) are now possible! To keep the ship from getting too crowded, a larger ship is available right away.
- **Rebalanced Moons**: Existing moons have been adjusted in terms of scrap yield, enemy presence, and much more. Additional fire exits, better access to different locations, and cruiser friendliness are also included.
- **New Interiors**: Various interiors (including the backrooms), Wesley's Interiors, the Lethal Office (inspired by [The Upturned](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1717770/The_Upturned/)), Deepcore Mines & some vanilla-style interiors are accessible.
- **Better Immersion**: Cave variants & new fog
- **New enemies**: Two additional threats: The Locker & The Cabinet. *Infestation variants and the reinstated Kidnapper Fox are also present.*
- **Mirages**: Masked individuals have found ways to imitate both the appearance and voice of an employee. They appear to be rare, but should be approached with caution.
- **Lategame Upgrades**: Various ship and equipment upgrades
- **Utility Slots**: Up to *2 additional equipment slots* may be purchased. Most items are compatible.
- **Quota Rollover**: In the event that all crew members die, the quota rollover will be reduced by 20%.
- **Terminal Improvements**: For further information have a look [at our Extended Terminal guide](https://github.com/Team-Rebirth/Lethal-Rebirth/wiki/Extended-Terminal).

### Known Issues

- **Game Crash when hosting after having been a client**: Restart the game whenever you have been a client and want to host a lobby afterwards.
- **Betterfog Preset Desync**: Betterfog might use the incorrect preset, which can be noticed by unfittig color or higher fog density than your peers.
  - **How to deal with it**: Press F1, disable autosync, then revert to vanilla mode or manually select the correct preset. To understand which preset is used when, check out the [BetterFog Configuration Guide](https://github.com/Team-Rebirth/Lethal-Rebirth/wiki/BetterFog).
- **General Desync**: Terminal purchases or similar functions may become unavailable to an operator.
  - **How to deal with it**: Affected personel must exit and rejoin the lobby.
- **Messed up screen width**: LCUltrawide_Community most likely is responsible. Occurs more often on linux systems apparently.
  - **How to deal with it**: Disable the mod and restart. As the mod is wholly clientside, it should be save to disable.
