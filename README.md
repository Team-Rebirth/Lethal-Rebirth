Lethal Company is an efficient operation, but imperfections remain. Bugs, instability, and questionable balance are regrettable liabilities. This package aims to correct those faults, enhancing your tools, and expanding the catalog. All without compromising performance in any significant manner. Efficiency is mandatory. Profit is expected.

## Operational Summary

### Major features

The directive of Lethal Rebirth is simple: Preserve the integrity of standard Company operations. Core procedures remain familiar, but efficiency has been refined. Alongside improved stability and performance, enhancements include:

- **Bigger Teams, bigger profit**: Studies done by the Company have found that bigger teams make for more efficient work. There is no extension of the provided living space (the Company financed ship).

- **Rebalanced Moons**: No new locations authorized. *Existing environments* have been adjusted for scrap yield, hostile presence, and navigation. Additional exits, traversal structures, and safety measures have been implemented where efficiency demanded.

- **New Interiors**: Generic environments (including The Backrooms), a Slaughter House, Wesley’s extensions, the Lethal Office (inspired by [The Upturned](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1717770/The_Upturned/)), and the Slaughterhouse are accessible.

- **Better Immersion**: Cave variants, new fog, and prettier foliage have been discovered.

- **New Hostiles**: Two additional threats: The Locker (situational hazard) and The Shrimp (from [The Upturned](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1717770/The_Upturned/)). *Infestation variants and the reinstated Kidnapper Fox are also present.*

- **Masked**: In recent events the Company has found that entities, known as the Masked, have found ways to both mimic appearance and voice of any given employee. They seem to be rare yet should be encountered with caution.

- **Lategame Upgrades**: Costs and functions adapted to progression.

- **Utility Slots**: Up to *3 additional equipment slots* may be purchased. Most items are compatible.

- **Quota Rollover**: In the event of total personnel loss, quota rollover will be reduced by 20%.

- **Terminal Improvements**: *Expanded interface functions*, including *purchase packs* and *lobby management systems*.

We recommend installing [LethalCasino](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/mrgrm7/LethalCasino/) if you aim for a more casual, relaxed experience when meeting your quota!

> An officially sanctioned outlet for risk-oriented employees. Sadly, in recent events the Company found that the assigned worth to a teammates bodies encourages desperate teams to resort to friendly fire. The Company asks you to refrain from such behavior for the benefit of morale, efficiency, and professionalism in this operation.

### Known Issues

- **Game Crash when hosting after having been a client**: Restart the game whenever you have been a client and want to host a lobby afterwards.

- **Betterfog Preset Desync**: Betterfog might use the incorrect preset, which can be noticed by unfittig color or higher fog density than your peers.
  - **How to deal with it**: Press F1, disable autosync, then revert to vanilla mode or manually select the correct preset. To understand which preset is used when, check out the [BetterFog Configuration Guide](https://github.com/Team-Rebirth/Lethal-Rebirth/wiki/BetterFog).

- **General Desync**: Terminal purchases or similar functions may become unavailable to an operator.
  - **How to deal with it**: Affected personel must exit and rejoin the lobby.

- **Messed up screen width**: LCUltrawide_Community most likely is responsible. Occurs more often on linux systems apparently.
  - **How to deal with it**: Disable the mod and restart. As the mod is wholly clientside, it should be save to disable.

## Installation

Two things are required:

- The game [Lethal Company](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966720/Lethal_Company/)
