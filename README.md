# Lethal Rebirth

Lethal Company is an efficient operation, but imperfections remain. Bugs, instability, and questionable balance are regrettable liabilities. This package corrects those faults, enhances your tools, and expands the catalog. All without compromising performance. Efficiency is mandatory. Profit is expected.

## Operational Summary

### Major features

The directive of Lethal Rebirth is simple: Preserve the integrity of standard Company operations. Core procedures remain familiar, but efficiency has been refined. Alongside improved stability and performance, enhancements include:

- **Rebalanced Moons**: *No new locations authorized.* Existing *environments have been adjusted* for scrap yield, hostile presence, and navigation. Additional exits, traversal structures, and safety measures have been implemented where efficiency demanded.

- **New Interiors**: Generic environments (including The Backrooms), Wesley’s extensions, the Lethal Office (inspired by [The Upturned](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1717770/The_Upturned/)), and the Slaughterhouse are accessible.

- **New Hostiles**: Two additional threats: The Locker (containment hazard) and The Shrimp (from [The Upturned](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1717770/The_Upturned/)). *Infestation variants and the reinstated Kidnapper Fox are also present.*

- **Lategame Upgrades**: Costs and functions adapted to progression.

  > ⚠️ The Hunter Upgrade is free of charge and replaces SellBodiesFixed. Acquisition must occur at round start.

- **Utility Slots**: Up to *3 additional equipment slots* may be purchased. Most items are compatible.

- **Quota Rollover**: In the event of total personnel loss, quota rollover will be reduced by 20%.

- **Terminal Improvements**: *Expanded interface functions*, including *purchase packs* and *lobby management systems*.

- **The Casino** An officially sanctioned outlet for risk-oriented employees.
