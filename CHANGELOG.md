## [unreleased/v2.0.0] - 2025-10-?? | The Overhaul Update (v73)

This update was initially planned as the "Ship & Weather Update". As we engaged with the weather aspect we found lots of balancing work to be done and thus focused on overhauling the modpack's difficulty and experience.
Just as we had the first release candidate for this update, the V73 update for Lethal Company came around. Thus the modpack developed some more, with V73 compatibility in mind.
