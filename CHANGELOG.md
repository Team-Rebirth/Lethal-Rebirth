# Changelog

## 1.1.0 - The Initiation Update (2025-08-28)

Delayed arrival due to minor technical difficulties.

### Minor Features

- The Company ordered new [AtomicStudio style cosmetics](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AtomicStudio/Atomics_Cosmetics/), [BigBadPigeon style cosmetics](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BigBadPigeon/PigeonsCosmeticsAddon/), and new [Atomic Studio style suits](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AtomicStudio/Atomics_Suits/).
- Added the [truest expression of a non-profitable crew by ManiaBania](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ManiaBania/1000_Quota_Stare/) and [a sworn allegence to Secure Control Protect operations by TeamClark](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/TeamClark/SCP_Foundation_Suit/).
- New [Polished_Plushies_and_Silly_Scrap by ScienceBird](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ScienceBird/Polished_Plushies_and_Silly_Scrap/) can be found scattered about now. Merch pollution sure is a thing...
- [Lugom's AstolfoPlushie](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Lugom/AstolfoPlushie/) has been added, for a friend ;D
- The BepInExPack terminal now only informs you of relevant things thanks to [falcodxb's LessLogs](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/falcodxb/LessLogs/) & does not spam some messages anymore thanks to [4902's NoConsoleSpam](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/4902/No_Console_Spam/).
- The MoreCompany Menu replacement has been reverted to the vanilla equivalent thanks to [DaXcess' NoMoreCompanyLogo](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DaXcess/NoMoreCompanyLogo/).
- Patch Mods have been added: [Slimetaming by EliteMasterEric](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/EliteMasterEric/SlimeTamingFix/), [BoomboxSyncFix by FutureSavior](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FutureSavior/Boombox_Sync_Fix/), and [ScanforItemsFix by ThePotato](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ThePotato/scanForItemsFix/).
- Due to sudden recent passings to prior unknown Fire-Exit Mimics, we extended the Coroner program with [CoronerMimics](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/EliteMasterEric/CoronerMimics/).
- We had [TooManySuits](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Verity/TooManySuits/) and thus implemented Verity's dimensional folding technology for the suit rack.
- Thanks to [ScienceBird_Tweaks](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ScienceBird/ScienceBird_Tweaks/) behavior of ship furniture & equipment and cat walks now line up with what'd be expected. Shotgun tooltips also are more helpful now.
- Removed [AtomicStudio's Better Shotgun Tooltips](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AtomicStudio/Better_Shotgun_Tooltip/) in favor of its implementation in [ScienceBird_Tweaks](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ScienceBird/ScienceBird_Tweaks/).

### Hotfixes

- Changed [BetterFog](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ironthumb/BetterFog/) foggy presets to be a bit more tolerable (foggy weather is slightly more comfortable/playable than in vanilla this way).
- Removed minor error (using a dot instead of a comma) in the [Chameleon](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ButteryStancakes/Chameleon/) configuration regarding snowy windows.

### Miscellaneous

- Updated dependencies & removed unneeded configs.
- Proper ReadMe & Documentation on the mods included and specific configurations on our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Team-Rebirth/Lethal-Rebirth/tree/main)!
- We now have a changelog.
