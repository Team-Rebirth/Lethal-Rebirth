# Denied Mods

> v2.0.0

This is a list of a lot of mods we have actively denied in the past and the reasoning behind it.

1. [QuotaOverhaul by LuciusofLegend](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/LuciusofLegend/QuotaOverhaul/): 1st of all, needlessly complex for our purposes. 2nd of all, we have no intention to change the way quotas are calculated as the vanilla way works well enough. We wish to work around that.
2. [CodeRebirth by XuXiaolan](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/XuXiaolan/CodeRebirth/): Ingenious mod, which sadly features way too many
3. StopBeesOpeningDoors - Too strong as a  "counter"-play option.
4. [InsanityRemastered](https://github.com/Toimis/InsanityRemastered): Too harsh of a penalty on solo player or team splitting strategies with over-the-top depiction of insanity.
5. [HotbarPlus by FlipMods](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/HotbarPlus/) - More slots break the dynamic of the limited capacity (which is already influenced enough by reserved utility slots) and might conflict with GeneralImprovements especially as it currently assumes all 4< slots are reserved slots.
6. [Oxygen by consequential](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/consequential/Oxygen/): Awesome idea yet far removed from vanilla and too infringing on the gameplay loop.
7. [Full_Darkness by IntegrityChaos](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/IntegrityChaos/Full_Darkness/): Make flashlights a necessity, which frankly sucks as they should remain a choice you make to make navigation more comfortable. Especially bad with the inclusion of apparatus/weather blackouts.
