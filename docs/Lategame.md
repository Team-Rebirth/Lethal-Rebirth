# Lategame Upgrades

> ⚠️ WIP:
> Needs to be expanded by A LOT. Describes V1.2.0.

The lategame upgrades serve the purpose of both making gameplay more rewarding and nicer as well as allowing the team to get much more efficient, allowing for better survival and better scrap gain.

The lategame upgrades mod (config file called "moreshipupgrades.cfg") adds many upgrades but due to concerns in mod compatibility with some, and potential balancing issues, we have disabled quite a few of them.

## Alternative Currency System

We use the alternative currency system provided by LGU which uses "Player Credits". These are optained in a ratio to the quota you make and are exclusively used to either buy LGUs or convert into company credits.

- Quota to PC: 75 credits in quota equal 1 PC.
- Credits to PC: 75 credits equal 1 PC.
- PC to Credits: 1PC equals 25 credits.
