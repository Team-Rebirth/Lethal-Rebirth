# Lategame Upgrades

> ⚠️ WIP:
> Needs to be expanded by A LOT. Describes V1.2.0.

The lategame upgrades serve the purpose of both making gameplay more rewarding and nicer as well as allowing the team to get much more efficient, allowing for better survival and better scrap gain.

The lategame upgrades mod (config file called "moreshipupgrades.cfg") adds many upgrades but due to concerns in mod compatibility with some, and potential balancing issues, we have disabled quite a few of them.

## Alternative Currency System

We use the alternative currency system provided by LGU which uses "Player Credits". These are optained in a ratio to the quota you make and are exclusively used to either buy LGUs or convert into company credits.

- Quota to PC: 75 credits in quota equal 1 PC.
- Credits to PC: 75 credits equal 1 PC.
- PC to Credits: 1PC equals 25 credits.

Reworked the [Lategame_Upgrades](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/malco/Lategame_Upgrades/) to use the alternative currency, Player Credits (PC). 75 credits in a fulfilled quota equal one player credit, while 50 common credits are equal to one player credit. When converting PC to credits, you obtain 25 credits for each PC. The configuration for the item progression has also been extended to properly consider every apparatus for unlocking the next cheapest upgrade. Additionally, the deep pockets upgrade has been disabled and there have been price rebalances across the board to make most initial increments cost less for less effect, which is then balanced out with additional or more costly increments after.
