            Hello there, whoever you may be. This hunk of junk turns out to have been upgraded in the past, 
            which is a surprise to me given that these ships and their equipment are meant to be brand new, though dated. But the way this one looks, I bet they just took this thing from some random old ship. 
            Its crew must have had someone good with computers, thus the log feature that I am using right now!\n\n
            Yet there are no logs left. Must have been whiped. 
            Either way, I shall use this to write about my experiences here, may they help someone.",
